# TicTacToe-Assembly

Assembly might not be anyone's first choice language for game development, but let's try anyway. This program allows two players to play tic tac toe. At the end of each game the players decide whether to play again.

Here's a demonstration:

```
Welcome to TicTacToessembly!

 1      |2      |3      
        |       |       
        |       |       
 -------+-------+-------
 4      |5      |6      
        |       |       
        |       |       
 -------+-------+-------
 7      |8      |9      
        |       |       
        |       |       

X's turn. Choose a square: 5

 1      |2      |3      
        |       |       
        |       |       
 -------+-------+-------
 4      |5      |6      
        |   X   |       
        |       |       
 -------+-------+-------
 7      |8      |9      
        |       |       
        |       |       

O's turn. Choose a square: 2

 1      |2      |3      
        |   O   |       
        |       |       
 -------+-------+-------
 4      |5      |6      
        |   X   |       
        |       |       
 -------+-------+-------
 7      |8      |9      
        |       |       
        |       |       

...

X wins!

 1      |2      |3      
    X   |   O   |   X   
        |       |       
 -------+-------+-------
 4      |5      |6      
        |   X   |   O   
        |       |       
 -------+-------+-------
 7      |8      |9      
    X   |       |   O   
        |       |       

X wins: 1
O wins: 0
Cats: 0

Play again (Y/N)? N

Goodbye!
